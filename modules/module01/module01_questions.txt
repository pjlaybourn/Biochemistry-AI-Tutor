BC 351: Principles of Biochemistry

Module 1: Study Guide Questions

1. Provide a very general description of cancer and cancer cells.

2. How are cancers typically classified?

3. Describe some of the evidence supporting the idea that cancers arise from a single cell that
has gone through a progression of changes.

18. Which of the three diagrams does not represent a functional group that forms an organic
acid and base?

21. The amino acid histidine has three ionizable groups, with pKa values of 1.8, 6.0, and 9.2.

a. Which pKa corresponds to the histidine side chain?

b. Which functional groups are the other pKas for?

c. In a solution at pH 5.4, will more than half, less than half, or exactly
half of the histidine side chains carry a positive charge?

d. What will be the overall net charge of the histidine molecules after addition of 2 OH-
equivalents?

e. Which of the three diagrams represents the titration curve on a pH vs. NaOH equivalents
plot?

f. Which of the four diagrams represents the protonation state of the histidine functional groups
at this net charge?
